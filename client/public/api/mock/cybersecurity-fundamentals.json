These fundamentals apply to every developer.\n\n## Why Should Developers Care About Security?\n\nDevelopers build the systems users trust with their data. What's your responsibility? To build secure systems and prevent common vulnerabilities.\n\n## OWASP Top 10\n\n### What vulnerabilities should concern you most?\n\nThe OWASP Top 10 lists the most critical web application security risks:\n\n1. **Broken Access Control** - Proper authorization is essential\n2. **Cryptographic Failures** - Protect sensitive data\n3. **Injection** - Validate and escape all inputs\n4. **Insecure Design** - Security considerations from the start\n5. **Security Misconfiguration** - Secure defaults matter\n6. **Vulnerable Components** - Keep dependencies updated\n7. **Identification and Authentication Failures** - Secure credential handling\n8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Verify authenticity\n9. **Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Track security events\n10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Validate outbound requests\n\n## Input Validation\n\nHow do you prevent injection attacks? Validate and sanitize all user input. Should you trust user input? Never.\n\n### What's the difference between validation and sanitization?\n\n**Validation** - Check if input is in expected format\n\n**Sanitization** - Remove or escape dangerous characters\n\n## Authentication and Authorization\n\n### How do you implement secure authentication?\n\n- Hash passwords with strong algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)\n- Use multi-factor authentication\n- Implement proper session management\n- Never store passwords in plain text\n\n### What's the difference between authentication and authorization?\n\n**Authentication** - Proving who you are\n\n**Authorization** - Determining what you can access\n\n## Cryptography Basics\n\n### Should you build your own crypto?\n\nNo. Use established libraries. What makes encryption secure? Strong algorithms (AES), proper key management, and authenticated encryption.\n\n## Secure Communication\n\nHow do you protect data in transit? Use HTTPS/TLS. Should you use HTTP? Only for non-sensitive content, and preferably not at all.\n\n### What's the role of HTTPS?\n\n- Encrypts data in transit\n- Verifies server identity\n- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks\n\n## API Security\n\n### How do you secure APIs?\n\n- Use authentication (OAuth, JWT)\n- Implement rate limiting\n- Validate input rigorously\n- Use HTTPS\n- Log access\n\n## Dependency Management\n\nHow often do you update dependencies? Security patches matter. Should you use dependencies with known vulnerabilities? Never. Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities.\n\n## Error Handling and Logging\n\n### What should you avoid in error messages?\n\nNever expose sensitive information:\n- Stack traces to users\n- Database structure\n- File paths\n- Internal IP addresses\n\n### What makes good security logging?\n\n- Log authentication attempts\n- Track authorization failures\n- Monitor suspicious patterns\n- Secure log storage\n\n## Security Testing\n\n### How do you test for security vulnerabilities?\n\n- Code review\n- Static analysis tools\n- Dynamic testing\n- Penetration testing\n\n## Secure Development Practices\n\nWhat practices embed security in development?\n\n- Threat modeling\n- Secure code review\n- Security testing\n- Regular training\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSecurity is everyone's responsibility. By following these fundamentals, you'll build more secure applications and protect your users."

Here are essential practices for success.\n\n## Performance is Critical\n\n### Why does mobile performance matter more than web?\n\nMobile devices have limited memory and battery. Every millisecond counts. How do you optimize performance? Profile early, avoid jank, and minimize battery drain.\n\n## User Interface Design\n\n### What makes a good mobile UI?\n\n- Touch-friendly targets (at least 44x44 points)\n- Simple navigation patterns\n- Readable text at arm's length\n- Responsive layouts\n\n## Network Considerations\n\nMobile networks are unreliable. Should you assume users are always online? No. Implement offline capabilities and graceful degradation.\n\n### How do you handle poor network conditions?\n\n- Cache data intelligently\n- Compress assets\n- Implement retry logic\n- Show clear loading states\n\n## Battery and Data\n\n### How can you reduce battery consumption?\n\n- Minimize background activity\n- Use efficient networking\n- Reduce GPS usage\n- Batch requests\n\nWhat about data usage? Users care about data limits. Provide options to reduce data consumption.\n\n## App Store Optimization\n\n### What factors help your app get discovered?\n\n- Clear app description\n- Compelling screenshots\n- Good ratings and reviews\n- Regular updates\n\n## Security Best Practices\n\n### Are mobile apps more vulnerable than web?\n\nYes, they are. Mobile-specific concerns include:\n\n- Secure storage of credentials\n- API security\n- Data encryption\n- Biometric authentication\n\n## Testing Mobile Apps\n\n### What testing strategies work best for mobile?\n\n- Device testing (real devices matter)\n- Emulator/simulator testing\n- Network condition testing\n- Performance testing\n\n## Cross-Platform Development\n\nShould you develop native or cross-platform? What are the trade-offs?\n\n**Native** - Best performance, full platform access, but separate codebases.\n\n**Cross-Platform** - Code reuse, faster development, potential performance trade-offs.\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Why is mobile accessibility important?\n\nMore people access content on mobile. Is accessibility important for all apps? Yes, it expands your audience and may be legally required.\n\n## Monitoring and Analytics\n\nHow do you understand user behavior? Implement analytics and crash reporting. Monitor performance metrics and user engagement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSuccessful mobile apps combine good design, solid performance, and reliable technology choices."

Let's explore how to design systems that truly scale.\n\n## What are Microservices?\n\nMicroservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service handles a specific business capability.\n\n### Why are microservices better than monolithic architectures?\n\nWhile monoliths are easier to start with, microservices provide better scalability, resilience, and development velocity. Each team can develop and deploy independently.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### How do you ensure your microservices remain maintainable?\n\n1. **Single Responsibility** - Each service does one thing well\n2. **Loose Coupling** - Services communicate via well-defined APIs\n3. **High Cohesion** - Related functionality lives together\n\n## Service Communication\n\nServices need to talk to each other. What are the main patterns? Synchronous communication via REST or gRPC, and asynchronous via message queues.\n\n### Which approach should you choose for your use case?\n\nConsider:\n- Latency requirements\n- Consistency needs\n- Complexity trade-offs\n\n## Scaling Considerations\n\n### How do you handle database scaling in microservices?\n\nEach service should have its own database. This prevents tight coupling and allows independent scaling. But how do you maintain data consistency across services? Implement eventual consistency patterns and distributed transactions carefully.\n\n## DevOps and Deployment\n\n### What containerization tools should modern teams use?\n\nDocker and Kubernetes have become industry standards. Kubernetes specifically helps with:\n\n- Automatic scaling\n- Self-healing\n- Rolling updates\n\n## Monitoring and Observability\n\n### How can you observe distributed systems effectively?\n\nImplement:\n- Centralized logging\n- Distributed tracing\n- Metrics collection\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\nWhat mistakes should you avoid when building microservices? Premature microservices, ignoring network latency, insufficient monitoring, and poor service boundaries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMicroservices can provide tremendous benefits, but they add complexity. Start monolithic, and refactor to microservices when justified by scale and team size."

Let's establish best practices.\n\n## Project Phases\n\n### What are the main phases of a data science project?\n\n1. **Problem Definition** - What are we solving?\n2. **Data Collection** - Gathering necessary data\n3. **Exploration** - Understanding the data\n4. **Modeling** - Building solutions\n5. **Evaluation** - Assessing performance\n6. **Deployment** - Putting models in production\n\n## Problem Definition\n\n### Why spend time on problem definition?\n\nMisunderstood problems lead to failed projects. Clearly define success metrics, scope, and constraints upfront.\n\n### How do you know if a problem is worth solving?\n\nConsider:\n- Business impact\n- Feasibility\n- Data availability\n- Technical complexity\n\n## Data Collection and Preparation\n\nWhat's the biggest time sink in data science? Data preparation. How much time do data scientists spend preparing data? Usually 70-80%.\n\n### How do you ensure data quality?\n\n- Validate data sources\n- Handle missing values\n- Detect and address outliers\n- Document data lineage\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n### What should EDA accomplish?\n\nUnderstanding your data deeply:\n\n- Identify distributions and patterns\n- Detect anomalies\n- Find relationships between variables\n- Inform feature engineering\n\n### Why is visualization crucial?\n\nVisualizations reveal patterns that summary statistics miss. What visualization tools work best? Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.\n\n## Feature Engineering\n\nHow much does feature engineering impact model performance? It can be as important as the algorithm choice. Should you focus on features or models? Always start with good features.\n\n### What makes a good feature?\n\n- Relevant to the problem\n- Captures important information\n- Not too many features (avoid curse of dimensionality)\n- Statistically independent\n\n## Model Development\n\n### How do you choose between algorithms?\n\nStart simple, then iterate. Linear models first, then more complex approaches if needed. How do you know when to try a complex model? When simple models don't achieve your goals.\n\n### Should you hyperparameter tune?\n\nYes, but only after establishing a baseline. Tune important hyperparameters, not all of them.\n\n## Evaluation and Validation\n\nWhat's worse: high bias or high variance? Depends on your use case. How do you choose appropriate metrics? They should align with business goals.\n\n### What validation strategy prevents overfitting?\n\n- Train/validation/test split\n- Cross-validation\n- Hold-out test set\n\n## Deployment and Monitoring\n\n### What happens after model deployment?\n\nThe real work begins. Models degrade over time as data distributions change. How do you monitor models?\n\n- Track prediction drift\n- Monitor accuracy\n- Alert on anomalies\n- Retrain regularly\n\n## Documentation and Reproducibility\n\n### Why is reproducibility critical?\n\nYou need to understand what worked and why. Can someone reproduce your results? Document everything:\n\n- Data sources and versions\n- Processing steps\n- Model hyperparameters\n- Results and findings\n\n## Collaboration\n\nHow do teams work effectively on data science projects? Clear communication, shared tools, and proper version control for code and models.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA structured workflow doesn't guarantee success, but it maximizes your chances. Invest in process early."

Let's explore them thoroughly.\n\n## What Are Hooks?\n\nHooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Why did React introduce hooks? To make code reusable, easier to test, and simpler to reason about.\n\n## useState Hook\n\n### How do you manage state with hooks?\n\nThe useState hook lets you add state to functional components:\n\n```javascript\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n```\n\n### Should you use multiple useState calls or combine state?\n\nLogically related state can be grouped, but independent state should be separate. This makes state management clearer.\n\n## useEffect Hook\n\n### What happens when you don't provide dependencies to useEffect?\n\nThe effect runs after every render, which can cause infinite loops. Always provide dependencies unless you want it to run every render.\n\n### How do you clean up effects?\n\nReturn a cleanup function from useEffect. This prevents memory leaks when unmounting.\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Can you create your own hooks?\n\nYes! Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions. What's the naming convention? Always start with 'use'.\n\n### What makes a good custom hook?\n\nA good hook:\n- Does one thing well\n- Is reusable across components\n- Has clear input and output\n\n## useContext Hook\n\nHow do you avoid prop drilling? useContext lets you access context values without passing props through every level.\n\n### When should you use context?\n\nFor global state like themes, authentication, or user preferences. Should you use context for all state? No, it can become unmaintainable.\n\n## useReducer Hook\n\n### What's the difference between useState and useReducer?\n\nuseReducer is better for complex state logic with many state transitions. useState is simpler for primitive values.\n\n## useRef Hook\n\n### When should you use refs?\n\nRefs are for accessing DOM elements directly. When do you need this? For focus management, media playback, or triggering animations.\n\n### Why is direct DOM manipulation usually discouraged?\n\nIt bypasses React's reconciliation and can lead to bugs. Use refs sparingly.\n\n## Rules of Hooks\n\n### What are the most important rules?\n\n1. **Call hooks at top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops or conditions\n2. **Call from React functions** - Only call from functional components or custom hooks\n\nWhy do these rules matter? They ensure hooks work consistently and predictably.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### How do useMemo and useCallback help performance?\n\nThey memoize values and functions to prevent unnecessary recalculations. Should you use them everywhere? Only when profiling shows they help.\n\n## Advanced Patterns\n\nWhat patterns make hooks more powerful? \n\n- Combining multiple hooks\n- Creating domain-specific hooks\n- Using hooks with TypeScript\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHooks have fundamentally improved React development. Master them and you'll write cleaner, more maintainable components."
